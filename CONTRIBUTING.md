## Introduction

### Please contribute!


## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code under threat of excommunication. Please report unacceptable behavior to [myersrdev@gmail.com][email] or your local law enforcement agency.

## How to Contribute

Standard git practices: 

* Pull requests.
* There is no testing procedure yet. You could do that.
* Don't make this too complicated. It is meant to be a demo app.
* Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can use to get familiar with git contributions: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

Example guideline for a forking approach for contributions
>1. Create your own fork of the code. Alternatively just make a branch.
>2. Do the changes in your fork or branch.
>3. Create pull request
>    * Be sure you have followed the [code style](#styleguides) for the project.
>    * Use descriptive Pull Request (PR) names
>    * If your PR is a Work in Progress (WIP) then prefix the title with "WIP-{descriptive feature name}
>4. A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one.

## Styleguides

1. You can only use vi.
2. Open parenthesis should start on the same line as the function.
3. Please Camel case.

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
